// think in: state → event → state
// State is a plain JavaScript object used by React to represent an information about the component's current situation. It's 

// example of state event state on myself :
// Initial state : I have poor financial situation
// the Initial view :I look poor and ugly 

// Event : I passed neog test and learned coding ,Improved skill and got a job at google

// New state : I have good financial situation and good skills
// New view : I look good and beautiful

// This is the same with React state and event
